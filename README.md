# OS-Proj4
OS Project 4

Project 4 for operating systems Due April 2

This project uses queue based scheduler

The file is compiled using the command "make"

Execution - ./oss -n 1 -s 1 -t 1 -i 1 -f logfile.txt

Not all functionalities have been implemented, the project is more difficult than expected. I plan on giving this project another try.
